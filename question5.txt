Hi Mr.Dev,

I have just received your email regarding customize Auto-Suggestion feature.
I hope that the information below will be of great help to you

    - How can I change the order of three blocks in the Suggestion result (Suggestion term, Collection and Product)?
    You can easily change the position order of each property (suggestions, collection, products) in DEFINE_SEARCH variable - Search.Js input-field

    - How can I integrate your feature to a specific textbox?
    Firstly you need to import all JS and CSS files in source code folder. 
    Then, please add some class name following the correct template structure 

    - Can I increase the number of character to two?
    As I have answered above in the first question, you can check MIN_LENGTH_INPUT_TRIGGER variable in Search.Js file, it represents for the length of data you entered.

    - I would like to customize the layout of the Product section in the Suggestion result. I have knowledge in JS and CSS so I can do it by myself.
    Can you please give me some instructions on how to do it?

    The layout of product section is what I defined as the layout property of DEFINE_SEARCH variable. You can edit it following your idea, please remember to add some CSS codes for this layout.


If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me. I look forward to hearing from you.
Have a good day
